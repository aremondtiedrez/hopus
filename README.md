The easiest way to see what HOPUS can do is to peruse this [notebook](
	https://colab.research.google.com/github/aremondtiedrez/hopus/blob/main/showcase.ipynb
) (via Google Colab).
This notebook leverages HOPUS utilities to clean data, train a variety of models, and
evaluate the performance of these models.

## Where does the data come from?

The data used to train the models therein was obtained
via the [RentCast API](https://www.rentcast.io/api).
