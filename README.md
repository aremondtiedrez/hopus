The easiest way to see what HOPUS can do is to peruse this [notebook](
https://colab.research.google.com/github/aremondtiedrez/hopus/blob/main/demo.ipynb
) (via Google Colab).
This notebook leverages HOPUS utilities to
- clean the raw data,
- train a variety of models for the prediction of real estate prices,
- evaluate the performance of these models, and
- display the model predictions on a geographical map.

(Temporary note: the ***old*** showcase notebook may be found
[here](

).)

## Where does the data come from?

The data used to train the models therein was obtained
via the [RentCast API](https://www.rentcast.io/api).
