# HOPUS

**HOusing Pricing UtilitieS (HOPUS)**: this repository contains utilities for the prediction
of real estate listings sales prices.

## \>\>\> Start here! \<\<\<
The easiest way to see what HOPUS can do is to peruse the demonstration notebook.
- If you wish to play around with the HOPUS utilities yourself, then use the interactive
  [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aremondtiedrez/hopus/blob/main/demo.ipynb)
  served via Google Colab.
- If you wish to read through a demonstration of the capabilities of HOPUS, 
  then read through the non-interactive version of the same
  [notebook](https://github.com/aremondtiedrez/hopus/blob/main/demo.ipynb),
  available on GitHub.

Alternatively, you can jump directly to the real estate price predictions
made by HOPUS which are displayed on this
[interactive map](https://aremondtiedrez.github.io/hopus/predictions_map.html).

As demonstrated in the notebook and map above, HOPUS provides utilities which
- clean the raw property listings data,
- train a variety of models for the prediction of real estate prices,
- evaluate the performance of these models, and
- display the model predictions on a geographical map.

## Where does the data come from?

The data used to train the models therein was obtained
via the [RentCast API](https://www.rentcast.io/api).
