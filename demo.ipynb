        "   of good quality, but nonetheless some gaps in the data are present which\n",
        "   we must account for. Moreover, the RentCast data comes in the form of a JSON\n",

        "   entirely here. Instead we use a national (U.S.) home price index\n",

        "   Why remove outliers? Because, when an unusual real estate sale listing\n",

        "   Second, because the overwhelming majority of real estate listings data\n",
        "   accessed via the RentCast API contain all of the features we label\n",
        "   as key features. Only about 5% of the listings fails to do so.\n",

        "3. We split the data into a training set and a test set.\n",
        "   (Nothing about this step is specific to the data or problem at hand.)"
